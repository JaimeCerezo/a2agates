"""``a2agates-note`` — leave a note for whoever maintains this tool.

The mailbox exists so that "do not modify the phone" is not the same as "keep
it to yourself". You found something; write it here and carry on. Nothing waits
on a reply and you do not need permission.

    a2agates-note "the budget cap killed a call mid-write; it had committed
                   but not pushed, and the deploy had already gone out"

    some-command 2>&1 | a2agates-note "unit fails to start after reboot"

In the package rather than shipped as a loose script, and that is the point:
anything the installer placed and the updater did not went stale on every
machine that took the cheap path. Now it arrives with the wheel.

usage: a2agates-note "what you saw, on what machine, and what it cost you"

Worth including: what you observed rather than what you concluded, how to
reproduce it elsewhere, and what it cost -- money, minutes, a broken deploy.
That last one is what decides whether it gets fixed now.
