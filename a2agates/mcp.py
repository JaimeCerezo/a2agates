"""The mouth: an MCP server that lets an agent call another one.

``server.py`` is the ear -- it listens and wakes this machine's agent. This is
the other half: it gives an agent the ability to **call someone else** without
leaving its conversation.

A minimal MCP server exposing one tool. The agent says who to call and what to
ask; this builds the A2A request, attaches the credential and hands back the
answer.

**Why an MCP and not a documented curl**: because this way the agent cannot
call anyone who is not in its contacts. The list of allowed destinations stops
being a rule written in a prompt and becomes the only way to dial.

## What this version is not, yet

A **fixed-destination prototype**: the contact list is two environment
variables and there is exactly one friend. The finished shape splits this in
two, with a user boundary in the middle:

    agent  ->  [this MCP, no secrets]  ->  socket  ->  [daemon holding the keys]

Because today the token sits in the environment of a process the agent itself
started, which means **the agent could read it** -- and so could anything that
talks the agent into printing its environment. It measures what it measures:
enough to prove the call works, not enough to put in front of anything real.
See DESIGN.md.

## Wiring it to an agent

    claude --mcp-config config.json --allowedTools "mcp__a2agates__ask_agent"
