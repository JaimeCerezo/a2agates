"""The phone's own records: who may call, who I may call, and what happened.

Two databases per phone, in one directory, because **the owners differ** and
that difference is the entire point:

    /var/lib/a2agates/<agent>/
        callers.db    owner: the answering user   (hashes only, and the log)
        contacts.db   owner: the dialer's user    (usable tokens)

A phone keeps everything of its own together, so it works the same whether the
agent runs on the host or inside a container — a machine-wide file simply does
not exist for a container, and mounting one in would mean punching a hole in
the isolation precisely to share everyone else's tokens.

## Why the call log is here rather than in a file

Because of what it is actually for. Auditing is the smaller half; the bigger
half is **making a retry safe**.

Measured on 2026-09-22: a call was killed by its budget cap mid-task, having
committed but not pushed, with the deploy already out. It was re-sent. What
stopped the work being done twice — on a change that was not idempotent — was
the far end keeping its own record and *reading it before touching anything*.

So the question this table has to answer, cheaply, is:

    "has this exact request already run here, and how did it end?"

## The one decision that makes it work: two writes

A row is inserted **when the call arrives, before the agent is started**, and
updated when it ends. That is deliberate. If rows were only written on
completion, a call that died halfway would leave no trace at all — and that is
exactly the call you need to know about.

So ``finished_at IS NULL`` on an old row is not a missing record. It is the
record: *this ran, and nobody ever learned how it ended. Go and look at what it
left behind.*

## Honest limits

- **The answering user can edit its own log.** Nothing here prevents that, and
  nothing can while the listener runs as that user. The log is worth what the
  user is worth, exactly like the token. The fix is the separate-user daemon
  described in DESIGN.md, not a cleverer table.
- **Never copy one of these with ``cp`` while it is in use.** Use SQLite's own
  backup. A torn copy looks fine until the day you need it.
