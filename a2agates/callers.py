"""Per-caller credentials: who is calling, not just whether the token matches.

Until now the ear compared the presented token against one string in a file.
That worked for the first pair and stopped working the moment there were two:
one token cannot be revoked for one caller without breaking the other, the log
can record an address but never a name, and "until when" and "from where" are
properties of the phone rather than of the caller.

This is the other half of the principle. All the policy is at the door — so the
door has to know who is standing in it.

## What is checked, in this order

1. **The hash matches a caller.** Only hashes are stored: a stolen copy of
   ``callers.db`` lets nobody call anybody.
2. **The row is not revoked.** Revoked rather than deleted, because *"who had
   access in March?"* is the question asked after a scare, and ``DELETE`` also
   erases the fact that the thing existed.
3. **It has not expired.**
4. **The address is allowed**, unless the caller is registered as
   ``0.0.0.0/0`` — which is a real answer, and has to be written out rather
   than left blank, so that "from anywhere" is a decision somebody made.

Every failure answers the same 401 with the same body. Telling a caller *which*
of the four it failed is telling an attacker which part of the credential it
got right.

## Two honest limits

**The address is only as good as what is in front.** Behind a reverse proxy the
socket peer is the proxy, so the check uses the forwarded address — and a
caller that already holds a valid token can put anything in that header unless
the proxy overwrites it. Treat the CIDR as a second lock on a stolen token, not
as proof of origin.

**``scope`` is recorded and not enforced.** It says what a caller was given the
number for; it does not cap what the agent may do, because capping the agent is
the blunt control this design rejects. A caller who should not be able to do
something needs a phone answered by a user who cannot do it.
