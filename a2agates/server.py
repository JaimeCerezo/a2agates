"""The ear: an A2A endpoint that wakes this machine's agent.

One server per agent. It listens on a port and, when a call arrives, runs the
``claude`` installed on this machine and returns whatever it answers.

Two deliberate properties, and they are the reason this exists rather than a
wrapper around something else:

  1. **It calls the machine's own ``claude``**, not one bundled inside an npm
     dependency. The agent that answers the phone has to be the same one that
     works in tmux, with its version, its memory and its configuration.
  2. **The card advertises the public address it is told**, not the interface
     it binds to. Without that, behind a proxy it publishes a number nobody
     can dial.

Everything about the protocol itself -- card, task states, artifacts, JSON-RPC
-- comes from the official A2A SDK. What lives here is the part nobody gives
away: how you reach the local agent.

Scope of this version: answer a call by starting a fresh agent, and keep the
thread if the caller comes back. It does not talk to an already-running tmux
session, it does not sign its card, and it has no callback webhook. See
DESIGN.md for what is decided and still unbuilt.
