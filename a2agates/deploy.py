"""The deployment, as data: fleet constants and the unit file, in one place.

These used to live in ``install.sh``, and that is the bug this module exists to
kill. It surfaced three times in one day, each time wearing a different hat:

* ``update.sh`` upgraded the package but never re-rendered the unit, so a phone
  that had been *updated* kept whatever ``ExecStart`` it was installed with.
  On 2026-09-22 that meant a current phone running without ``--db`` — it
  answered calls perfectly and recorded not one of them. Nobody could tell,
  because a missing log looks exactly like a quiet week.
* the command-line tools were placed by the installer and not by the updater,
  so an updated machine could be on the newest version with none of the
  commands that make it usable.
* and the limits are supposed to be fleet constants, but only the installer
  knew them, so an old phone kept old limits forever.

The pattern underneath all three: **a machine that updates is not the same as a
machine that reinstalls**, and anything only the installer knows drifts away
silently on every machine that takes the cheap path — which is every machine,
because the cheap path is the one we told them to take.

So the deployment is defined here, inside the package. Both scripts render it
from whatever version is installed, and neither holds a second copy that can
fall behind.
